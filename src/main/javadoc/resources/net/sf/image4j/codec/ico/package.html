      ICO codec implementation, which allows encoding and decoding of MS ICO format.
    </p>
    <p>
      ICO images typically contain multiple images of various sizes and colour depths.  Thus,
      this codec implementation provides methods to decode an ICO image as a list of <tt>BufferedImage</tt> objects,
      and to encode a list of <tt>BufferedImage</tt> objects as an ICO image.
