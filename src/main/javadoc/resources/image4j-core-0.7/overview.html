      All sub-packages under the <tt>codec</tt> package provide the implementation for a particular codec.  The naming convension
      is as follows:
    </p>
    <table border="1">
      <tr><th>Element</th><th>Description</th>
      <tr><td><tt>package &lt;codec&gt;</tt></td><td>Package containing codec implementation</td></tr>
      <tr><td style="margin-left: 1em;"><tt>class &lt;codec&gt;Decoder</tt></td><td>Decoder class</td></tr>
      <tr><td style="margin-left: 1em;"><tt>class &lt;codec&gt;Encoder</tt></td><td>Encoder class</td></tr>        
    </table>
    <p>
      The Decoder and Encoder classes provide various static <tt>read</tt> and <tt>write</tt> methods respectively, which
      provide the functionality for decoding and encoding images.
